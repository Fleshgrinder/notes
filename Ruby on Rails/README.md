## Access Rails console

```shell
# Using your global version of Rails:
rails c

# Using the local version of Rails defined in your Gemfile:
bundle exec rails c
```

## Clean up unused gems in your bundler directory

```shell
# Print the changes, but do not clean the unused gems.
bundle clean --dry-run

# Force a clean even if --path is not set.
bundle clean --force
```

## Format .erb files in VsCode

This is not a good solution but it is the best I could find.
Add to your workspace settings:
```json
"files.associations": {
   "*.html.erb": "html"
}
```

- [Prettier .erb support request](https://github.com/prettier/plugin-ruby/issues/371)

## Run (focus on) one test only out of a suite of tests

```shell
bundle exec rspec path/file_spec.rb:32
```
