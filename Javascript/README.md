## Frameworks and Libraries

A framework owns the main() function, it performs some function like managing a collection of windows on the screen, it can run even without customization. The framework defines the overall nature of the program, while your code provides specific customizations.

A library is a box of tools used by your code. Your code owns main() and provides the overall structure of the program. The library does some specific task, like sending traffic over the network, computing bessel functions, etc. A library can do big things, like draw a view of a three-dimensional space full of objects, but only after you tell it about the objects.
